# #690. Employee Importance

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, his **importance value** and his **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
```

**Note:**
1. One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
2. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.
